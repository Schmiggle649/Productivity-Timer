# Productivity Timer
Welcome to Productivity Timer, a program that lets you create a list of tasks with each task linked to a timer!

## Site
https://schmiggle649.github.io/Productivity-Timer/

## Usage
Simply set a time in hours, minutes, and seconds along with the name of the task, and it will be added into the queue.
You can start and pause the timer, or you can skip ahead to the next timer in the queue.

## Future
This is an ongoing project that I plan to update regularly.
Future update plans include easier queue manipulation (deleting items or moving items around), customizable backgrounds and sounds, Pomodoro Technique, and more!
