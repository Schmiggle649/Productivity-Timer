#Productivity Timer
Welcome to Productivity Timer, a program that lets you create a list of tasks with each task linked to a timer!

##Site
https://schmiggle649.github.io/Productivity-Timer/

##Usage
Simply set a time in hours, minutes, and seconds along with the name of the task, and it will be added into the queue.

##Future
This is an ongoing project that I plan to update regularly.
Future update plans include easier queue manipulation (deleting items or moving items around), customizable backgrounds and sounds, Pomodoro Technique, and more!
